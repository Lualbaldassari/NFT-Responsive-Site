Absolute units :
Always appear the same size no matter where you 
view them(px)

Relative units :
They are relative to another value
(percentages )

Percentages :
When using a percentage for width the percentage is based on the width of its
parent element 

maximum-width:

If the width goes above max-width, keep it at max width.
If the width is below max-width, keep it on width


The em unit: 
*Relative units are named that way because 
they are relative to another value*

And ems in particular are used to set dynamic
font sizes that are relative to their parten font
sizes 

Margin and padding values in em are relative to the
element's current font-size value

Rem unit: always relative to the root html element
